# PDFPrompter
The "PDFPrompter" holds the foundation for the groundbreaking "PDF Assistant" application, designed to provide accurate responses to inquiries based on the content of a specified PDF document. Within this project, the LangChain4J framework serves as the conduit for seamless communication with OpenAI's powerful LLM (Large Language Model), enabling the extraction of meaningful insights from PDF data.

Additionally, the integration of AstraDB facilitates the storage of document embeddings, enabling efficient retrieval and manipulation of data for enhanced performance. Spring Boot, a robust framework for creating lightweight and flexible Java-based web services, forms the backbone of the application's REST API, ensuring a streamlined and efficient communication interface for seamless interaction with the PDF Assistant.

By harmoniously combining these technologies, the PDF Assistant empowers users to derive valuable information and articulate relevant queries, thereby transforming the traditional static nature of PDF documents into a dynamic, interactive knowledge resource.

This comprehensive and innovative approach positions the "PDF Assistant" as a pioneering solution for information retrieval and knowledge extraction, catering to diverse academic, professional, and research-oriented pursuits.
